When the dissolution_date is present and in the past this will set the [inactive](inactive) field to true. If there is a future dissolution_date present while the current_status remains as 'Active' then OC will display this as an 'Expiry Date' rather than a dissolution date (as seen in Ohio)

If these dates are also available in the registry then we will not edit them as the registry may make changes to them at a later date.
