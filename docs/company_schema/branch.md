A flag to indicate if a company is a 'branch'. If the flag is 'F' it indicates this the entry in the company register relates to an an out-of-jurisdiction company (sometimes called a 'foreign corporation' in the US). If it is 'L' it is a local office of a company (few company registers collect this information). If it is null value, it means either the company is not a branch, or the company register does not make the information available
