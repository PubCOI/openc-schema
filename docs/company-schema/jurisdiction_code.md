The jurisdiction code is the code for the jurisdiction which registered the company. If this is a country it is simply the two-letter ISO code for that country, e.g. Spain = es, United Kingdom = gb. If this is a state or province it is an underscore version of the ISO 3166-2 code for the jurisdiction, eg. Michigan in the US is us_mi.
