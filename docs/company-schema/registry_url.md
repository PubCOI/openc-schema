Where possible, links to the canonical company page on the source register. Where a registry publishes Open Data then we attempt to determine the link to the company page, but where we are unable to do this (e.g. if the design of the site precludes it), then the field may be empty. Not all company registers provide persistent urls for the companies in the register.
