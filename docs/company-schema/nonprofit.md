OpenCorporates mapping based on company_type.

A Non-Profit company is a company where any profits are utilised to further the company's goals, rather than being distributed to shareholders or directors. These companies can be charities, however not all non-profit companies are charities. OpenCorporates marks as "Non-Profit" many not-for-profit jurisdiction-specific company types such as, in the US state of Louisiana, "Non-Profit Corporation" and "Non-Profit Religious Corporation".
