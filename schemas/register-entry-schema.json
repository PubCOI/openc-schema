  "description": "A Register Entry represents an entry in an official register, such as a charity/nonprofit register, or register of lobbyists, for example. Some registers -- such as the Charity Register for England & Wales have a statutory purpose, and act as a record of effectively licensing an entity to operate as a charity (as do, for example, some banking registers). Others, such as the UK's voluntary lobbying register, or the Canadian register of exporters, are more collections of entities and their activities. In general we are using register entries for those registers where there is no good normalised useful model; but where we have something such as the FCA's register of financial advisers etc, which is essentially a record of licences issued to operate in financial markets, we recommend modelling as licences.",
